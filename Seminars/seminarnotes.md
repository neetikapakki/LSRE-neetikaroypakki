ARTICLE “The art and science of release planning"

Through this paper, the author has expressed his views on what a release plan means, difficulties faced in creating a release plan and the different types of approaches to release plan. Release planning helps in decision making for selecting features and assigning them in order to create a sequence of consecutive products release. Creating a release plan is not an easy task. A proper understanding of the planning objectives, constrains and important stakeholders and the feature preference is necessary. RP rarely relies on a popular model or methodology. Optimal selection and selecting features involve the rise of the complexity factor. More time is consumed for planning and follow up re-planning is being practised.
There are two kinds of approaches to the release planning.

1.	The art of release planning approach: This approach is involves the human intelligence in handling the conflicting objectives and constrains.
2.	The science of release planning approach: This approach deals the problems by formalizing them and use computational algorithms to obtain the best solutions.

The art of release planning approach:
 As the RP is not well defined and there is an organization’s lack of emphasis in the processes due to the lack of maturity in the RP process, it involves human intuition, communication and capabilities to solve the problem before seeking for its solution. In agile development, RP concentrates on planning on the next iteration which is done by conducting physical meetings among the most important stakeholders in order to discuss which features to be developed next and the effort calculation for those features. However RP fails to work well in deciding features and to prioritise them when large number stakeholders are involves in the agile development.

The science of release planning approach: 
In this approach by trying to formulating the problem approximately so that by working on this formulized problem, we can get the meaningful result. Different optimization approaches are modelled that helps in working on the features that satisfies the customer need within the given budget. These optimization approaches are most suitable for large size problems but somehow fails to give the costumer a chance to take part in the RP decisions and also they don’t plan beyond a single release. Decision variables are also considered that focuses on the set of new functionality, costumers’ change request, or defect correction and the features are assigned to a finite number K of release option. This approach also deals with the two types of dependency constrains C (coupling relation) and P (precedence relation), where coupled features are to be released jointly as they depend on each other and the precedent feature are released in a specific order. As all resources play an important role in the RP, while discussing and calculating the resources constrains, constrains that are related to budget and effort resources are taken into consideration.  As not all the stakeholders hold the equal importance, a scale that measures the importance level of each stakeholder is considered and is calculated in order to identify the most important stakeholders. Features are prioritised based on the values and urgency by using an ordinal nine point scale. An equation is formed by making certain assumptions that helps in forming a balance way of the planning objectives that includes aspects such as value, risk, urgency, satisfaction, dissatisfaction and return on the investment.
This paper also discuss about the hybrid approach based on integer linear programming. The algorithm adopted in this approach helps in solving the sequence of linear programming problems without integer conditions after which the problems are well understood and solved efficiently. To generate a set of good solutions, this approach is combined with heuristics. Though this approach, the set problems as variants of the original formal model are formulated after which the problem variants are solved in order to get a set of qualified alternative solutions. Since there is a coping problem in both art and science base approach, this hybrid approach offers a high level framework stressing on the continuous process that works on planning and re-planning.  Different tasks are performed in the three phases to improve this approach during the planning process.
Modelling phase:  The main activities in this phase are planning objective and constrains, offering stakeholder voting and estimation of resources.
Exploration phase: Algorithms are developed on integer programming to find out the solution space and generate alternative solutions.
Consolidation phase: Algorithms are developed that helps the decision makers to understand the problem better. The decision made after solving the problems, help in reducing the size of the problem and the complexity for the next iteration. At the end of the paper, a problem is considered as an example and the solution process is discussed.

summary for the article “A market-driven requirements engineering process:results from an industrial process improvement programme”.
Basic idea of this paper: an improvement program REPEAT is developed that helps the improvement in release precision and product quality by considering the elements such as prioritisation of requirements, the effort estimation, the detailed requirements specification, and the continuous change management throughout design, implementation and verification that are used in the REPEAT.  
This paper focuses on the requirement engineering processes used in package software companies. REPEAT (Requirements Engineering ProcEss At Telelogic) is used in- house at telegolic(a fast growing company) for extracting, selecting and managing the requirements on a product family called telelogic tau which is a software development environment for real time systems that uses graphical languages and provide code generator for integrating several real time operating system and is used by large telecommunication systems providers in their software development. REPEAT manages the requirements throughout the release cycle by including activities such as elicitation, selection, management, documentation and validation and release planning of the requirements. There are different actors involved in REPEAT such as Requirements Management Group (RQMG), issuer, customer and developer, requirements team, construction team, test team, experts, requirements database. The elicitation of the requirement is a continuous process and the issuer issues a requirement at any time based on the market need. The requirements are stored in the database with a unique identity so that in the REPEAT process each requirement has a life cycle processing through different stages. With the support of the experts, the RQMG decides on requirement transitions on the states such as new, assigned, classified, rejected, selected and applied. There are different phases involved in the process of REPEAT such as;
Elicitation phase: in this phase the issuer collects the requirements and reasons for selecting that requirement along with its description is also given and is given an initial priority P.  These requirements are checked by the RQMG and sent back to the issuer for more clarification purpose of the requirement description. Then the experts classify the requirements to cost C and Impact effort estimation. If the effort is more than it is estimated, then the requirement is decomposed to smaller requirements considering the cost impact and the priority of the requirement.
Selection phase: this phase involves activities such as selecting the requirement to be implemented in the current release, specifying the selected requirements in more detail and validating the requirement document. 
Change management phase: based on the priority, the RD changes and when this happens a new requirement enters to the starting phases of the REPEAT process.
Construction: this is made by using a iterative design and implementation process and unit test 
Conclusion phase: final report is written which summarise the lesson learned in the REPEAT enactment.
Verification: The implemented requirements that are in the selected list are verified against RD using requirements-  based testing method
After this a partial process scenario model is designed that shows the event related to one requirement. And at the end of this paper, challenges such as over load control, connection fragment, cost value use case prioritisation etc were identified that are occurred while implementing REPEAT.


SEMINAR 2 HOMEWORK:
BOSTON MATRIX:
Boston matrix that is developed by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is a marketing tool that analysis and manages the product portfolio which helps the investor to decide on which product he/she has to invest. 
Functionality of this tool:
This tool classifies the products in four categories based in the market share and the market growth.

1.	Dog: The products that are in dog category have low market share and low market growth. This means that these products do not consume nor will they generate much cost.

2.	Cash Cow: the assets of the products are much higher than the market growth in this category. So they generate most income then that is consumed.

3.	Question mark: these are the product that consumes large amount of cash by providing a high growth in the market and as they have low market share they don’t generate much income. These products can be places in the star category if the market share rises and also can be placed in cash cow if the market growth is slow.

4.	Star: these products produce and consume large amount of cash because their market growth is high and at the same time its market share is equally high. When the market growth falls for these products, they will become cash cow.

Gap analysis:

This analysis mainly focuses on what the business is doing currently and where it wants to reach. This analysis is carried out by identifying the gaps by the process of comparing the actual performance with the desire performance. In order to perform the gap analysis, it is important to understand the expectation level of the performance in a company so that comparison of the current performance level with the expected performance level is done.

This analysis can be performed at the strategic level and the operational level.

It provides the company/ organisation with a foundation for measuring investment of time/ money/ human resources required to reach the desire goal.

This analysis can be used as a ranking of good, average and poor.

Planning gap is the process of comparing the forecast profits to the desire profits of the company. Planning gap is divided into two main elements:

1.	Usage gap:  This is the gap between the total potential for the market and the current usage by the consumers in the market.
            Usage gap= market potential – existing usage

2.	Product gap: A particular organisation is removed from the part of the market because of product or service characteristics.   

Gap process includes the following steps:

1.	Identifying the existing process: it is important to know what process/ method the company/ organisation is using.

2.	Identifying the existing outcome: to identify the current status of the outcome that the company is producing.

3.	Identifying the desire outcome: to identify what the company/ organisation wants.

4.	Identifying the process to achieve the desire outcome: to identify the procedure or the process that the company/ organisation uses to achieve the desire outcome.

5.	Identify and document the gap: to find the difference between the current outcome and the desire outcome.

6.	Develop the means to fill the gap: develop and using the correct tools or techniques required to fill the gap and reach the desire goal.

7.	  Develop and prioritise the requirements to bridge the gap.

HOMEWORK:
The order of magnitude in RE is based on the size of the sets of requirement that are handled by the organization in developing a software intensive system [1]. The order of magnitude also relieves the effort that is required in managing the complete sets of interdependencies of the requirements.  

The order to magnitude in RE are categorised in 4 levels.

Level 1 - Small scale requirement engineering (SSRE)

The order of magnitude (or) the number of requirements the organisation can handle is: 10

Effort required: less effort 

Level 2 – Medium scale requirement engineering (MSRE)	

 The order of magnitude (or) the number of requirements the organisation can handle is: 100

Effort required: managing the set of requirements at this level is feasible but requires large effort.  

Level 3 – Large scale requirement engineering (LSRE)

The order of magnitude (or) the number of requirements the organisation can handle is: 1000

Effort required: practically unfeasible but feasible among small bundles of requirements.  

Level 4 – Very large scale requirement engineering (MSRE)

The order of magnitude (or) the number of requirements the organisation can handle is: 10000

Effort required: Managing a complete set of interdependencies among small bundles of requirements is unfeasible in practice.

HOMEWORK QUESTION

Road mapping:
A roadmap is a strategic plan that provides the steps an organisation needs to take to achieve stated outcomes and goals. It provides vision to the links among tasks and priorities for action in the near, medium and long term. Metrics and milestone provided by the roadmap allow the organisation having a regular tracking of progress towards the goals.
There are specific key elements of a successful roadmap:
 
  A roadmap will contain a clear statement of desire outcome that follow a specific pathway for reaching the goal. The pathway contains the following:
  
1.	Goals: A clear and concise set of targets that, if achieved, will result in the desired outcome; quantified goals.

2.	Milestones: the interim performance targets for achieving the goals, pegged to specific dates.

3.	Gaps and barriers: a list of any potential gaps in knowledge, technology limitations, market structural barriers, regulatory limitations, public acceptance or other barriers to achieving the goals and milestones.

4.	Action items: actions that can be taken to overcome any gaps or barriers that stand in the way of achieving the goals; typical solution actions include technology development and deployment, development of regulations and standards, policy formulation, creation of financing mechanisms, and public engagement.

5.	Priorities and timelines: a list of the most important actions that need to be taken in order to achieve the goals and the time frames, taking into account interconnections among those actions and stakeholder roles and relationships.

HOMEWORK ARTICLE:

Aim:

This paper focuses on the importance and analysis of QR in different companies.
Data collection area:
The data is collected by carrying out a semi structured interview which is conducted to the one project manager and one product leader each from 11 different industries that are selected by the gate keeper of corresponding industries that examines QR in practice. The collected data also includes the perspective of comparing B2B and B2C analysis which presents new data from all 11 cases.
4 RQ’s where formed and analysis of QR in related to each of the RQ is done by interviewing the 22 participators of 11 companies from various perspectives.

RQ1: What QR’s are considered most important and are there any distinguishably characteristics in relation to costumer type (B2B or B2C)?

RQ2: What interdependencies between QR are present in the companies?
	
	RQ2.1: What interdependencies are deemed most important, and how does this compare to the previous studies?
	
	RQ2.2: To what extent are interdependencies elicited analysed and documented?

RQ3: How are cost estimations of QR are performed, and what is the accuracy of these cost estimates?

RQ4: To what extent are QR dismissed from the project after project initiation?
	
	RQ4.1: If QR‘s are dismissed, is any consequences analysis performed pre– post dismissal?
	
	RQ4.2: Are RQ’s are specified in a measurable manner?

In relation to RQ1, for the findings the researchers have considered few Quality requirements such as usability, performance, reliability, stability and etc and researchers have tried to found out which requirement is considered most important. For B2B usability is considered most important and for B2C safety is considered most important. Depending on the company type the researchers enable to focus on certain quality aspects. Not all QR’s are given the same importance in all the companies. Each requirement is given different priorities based on the type of company and its specifications. Aimed approach could be one of the solutions in handling the different types of requirements in different types on companies.

In relation to RQ2 a set of six predefined interdependency types (AND, REQUIRES, TEMPORAL, CVALUE, ICOST, OR) were used by the interviewees to characterize perceived interdependencies, both among different QR and interdependencies between QR and FR. TXOR (time related exclusive) is an additional interdependency a  interviewee added  when given an option to add any additional interdependencies. The findings for RQ2, interdependencies, show that:

1)	REQUIRES and CVALUE are considered as the most common and important interdependency types to identify.

2)	B2B viewed REQUIRES as the most common and important one, B2C considered CAVLUE.

3)	AND and OR were considered the least common and least important interdependency types.

The reason for dealing with interdependencies is a complex task and the number of potential dependencies may be very large, resulting in an ad hoc approach to interdependency management where only a limited set of critical interdependencies are dealt with. Interdependencies can have a critical impact on product development in terms of planning, design, and quality. One of the interviewee stated that QR are assumed and so not actively looked for whereas another employee stated that the main focus should be on the functionality that will fulfil the customer needs and not on reflecting over QR. Moreover after the complete analysis, five of the companies reported that the order of implementation is affected by interdependencies where as the other company reported that delays or exclusions of requirements may be the result of QR interdependencies, which also affects what is implemented. The rest companies stated that the quality of the product is affected, e.g., performance and maintainability.

In relation to RQ3, cost estimation of QR, the findings show that:

1. There is no distinction between FR and QR during cost estimation.

2. Expert opinion is the predominant method for estimation.

3. In the worst case, B2B has much more inaccurate estimates than B2C.

 It is important to estimate the QR which is related to the impact of the entire system and span over all FR because this will make it difficult to estimate cost accurately. The major reasons for inaccurate estimates of requirements are overoptimistic estimates and user changes or misunderstandings. Therefore, it is important for practitioners to understand that estimates of QR demand a deeper analysis, and using the same resources and methods for QR and FR may not provide accurate estimates.

The findings for RQ4, dismissal of QR, show that:
At many cases there is a disagreement between the PM and the PL of the same companies in the issue related to the view of how often QR are quantified. In some cases the PM views differed, stating always or never. Almost in all the companies the views of the PM and the PL were quite different. This is due the communication gap between the PM and the PL. The analysis shows that:

1.	All QR are dismissed from the projects at some stage during development, with little or no consequence analysis performed.

2.	For B2C, performance requirements are more often dismissed due to the difficulties in proper estimation, while for B2B, QR that are not considered important, for example, usability, are more often dismissed than performance requirements.

3.	Poor cost estimation and the fact that QR has lower priority than FR are the main reason for dismissal.

It is important to acknowledge the participator about the importance of QR needs not only in theory but also in practice. It is important for them to understand and accept the fact that the dismissal of the QR may solve a short term problem but on a long term basis it will reduce the competitive advantages and the value of the system. To lower the dismiss rate of QR by improving the specification and quantification of the more difficult ones, it may be easier to keep them in the project instead of dismissing them when running out of time. However, the main problem is that QR are not taken into consideration during product planning and thus not included as hard requirements in the projects, making the realization of QR a reactive rather than a proactive effort. Product management may thus not be able to plan and rely on QR to achieve competitive advantages.

“What Happened to Our Features? Visualization and Understanding of Scope Change Dynamics in a Large-Scale Industrial Setting”

The change in the decision on which feature or requirement has to be added or removed from the developing system depends on the change in the circumstances and demands for future improvement of the system.  This may cause dynamic evolution of the scope of software asset investments. In order to solve this problem, the researchers have presented a technique called Feature Survival Charts for visualization of scoping change dynamics. It is not practically possible to consider large number of requirements, so it is important to select a subset of requirements that can be useful for the upcoming improvement of any specific system. This process of selecting the requirements is called scoping. The proposed set of scope tracking measurements complements the proposed visualization technique, and they aim at further increasing the understanding of the rationale and dynamics of scope changes. The visualization technique provides feedback about ongoing scoping activities as well as a visualization of past project scoping activities. In scope tracking measurement the questions were formulated related to the external attributes of the scoping process which also connects to the internal attributes. The set of five scope tracking measurements is divided into time related measurements and feature related measurements are mentioned below.
Number of positive and negative scope changes per time stamp/baseline (M1) – This measurement comes under the 
Time to feature removal (M2)
Number of state changes per feature (M3)
Time to birth (M4)
Reason for scoping decision (M5)

For the purpose of scoping decision, the measurements discussed complement the visualization technique by quantitative characterization and qualitative rationale. The practitioners have highlighted the usefulness of the visualization technique and the scope tracking technique since they confirm the volatility of the scope and provide a tool to analyze the various aspects of this phenomenon. Case companies have use this results to adjust the process of scope setting decision more flexible. The results give a better overview of the scoping process of the whole project on a single page size graph. This method can be used in large scale projects and also if the characteristic of the scope changes, the manner in which the graphs together with measurements are used to increase the understanding of the performance of the scoping process is generally applicable.
Limitation:
1.	One threat is related to the mapping between measurements and external attributes.
2.	Another threat is related to the generalization of the results.

HOMEWORK QUESTIONS

Any large organisation needs an efficient RE process where the number of new requirements increases whiles the management resources cannot be increased accordingly.  The RE process is often described as cyclic with each cycle consisting of elicitation, analysis and validation activities [1] [2]. Large scale requirement engineering (LSRE) is defined based on the size of the requirements set that is considered in the market driven requirements. Generally in large scale requirement engineering the order of magnitude exceeds 1000 requirements. Managing a complete set of interdependencies in LSRE is practically unfeasible, but feasible among small bundles of requirements [3].

“Requirement Abstract model”

Requirement abstract model (RAM) mainly focuses on the product perspective, supporting a continuous requirement engineering effort, aimed at taking requirements of multiple types (abstraction level) as input, and offers a structure for the work-up of these requirements, i.e., breaking down abstract requirements into detailed ones and vice versa.

This model involves three steps.

1.	Specify:

This involves specifying the initial requirements and eliciting information to an extent of it being understood by the project manager performing continues requirements engineering. This step includes four attributes;

a.	Description: this attribute describes the centre essence of the requirements.

b.	Reason/ benefits/ rationale: this attributes consist of 2 parts. Why the requirements are specified and benefits of the requirements specified. 

c.	Risk: this attributes describes the risks with the requirements that are not specified.

d.	Title: this attribute should reflect the content of the requirement.   

2.	Place:

 This step analyse the requirements and place them in the level they belong. There are four levels: product level, feature level, functional level and the component level. In product level, the main focus will be on the goals, product strategies and indirectly on the organization strategies. Requirements which are features of the product are placed at the feature level. Features are characteristics of the system; requirements at this level provide abstract descriptions of these characteristics. At the functional level each requirement is described in such a way that it clearly shows what a user or system can do. In the component level the Requirements will have detailed information. Component Level can also act as clarification to one or more Function Level requirements.

3.	Abstraction:
This step involves abstracting and/or breakdown of a requirement, depending on the initial placement of the original requirement. New requirements are created on adjacent abstraction levels or linking to already existing one, depending on the situation. Every requirement has to be abstracted to the product level. For this 2 rules are set up.

R1. No requirement may exist without having a connection to the Product Level.

R2. All requirements have to be broken down to Function Level.

An example is considered that shows the work-up process of this model where the original requirement that belongs to the feature level is considered. According to the R1, it is mandatory to connect the original requirement in the feature level to the product level by creating the requirements. After which R2 is followed, where all the requirement are to be broken down to the functional level by creating the requirements. The breakdown to Component Level offers further details to relatively low-level requirements and is often associated with suggestions of how to implement a requirement.
There are additional attributes other then the attributes mentioned in the specify step. Requirement Source, Requirement Owner, Requirements Manager, Relation/dependency, State, Reject reason, Due date, Version, Date of creation, Last changed are the additional attributes that can be mandatory (manual or auto generated), optional. Further these attributes are related to either traceability or roles attribute or to process attribute.

Later in this article the state of the requirements in RAM is explained using a diagram.
There are generally four states a requirement be in. 

A.	Draft requirement

B.	Rejected requirement

C.	Incompletely specified

G.	Refined requirement  

In continuous RE, a requirement X is drafted to state A. Here if the requirement is incomplete it is sent to the state C or it is sent to state B if the requirement is out of scope. If it does not belong to both the states, then it is accepted for prioritization and sends to state D (internal prioritized requirement). If we find out that this requirement has low priority i.e. it is out of scope for the current plan then it is send to the state E (postponed requirements). After the requirement is prioritized, it is accepted for the plan and sent to the state F (planned requirement) and further sent to state G (refined requirement) and these requirements to designed are sent to started requirement state H, after which the process in completed. Requirements with the lower priority are send back to state E from state F, G, H. 

In the next section of this paper, validation of RAM in industry against an organization faced with the improvement issues is discussed. There are two types of validation.

1.	Static validation: The static validation consists of reviews and walkthroughs of RAM

2.	Dynamic validation: the dynamic validation consists of a live industry requirements engineering effort where the model was put through its phases.

The roles involves in Static Validation One involved eliciting feedback/ input regarding RAM:

(A) Product Manager (two persons interviewed)

(B) Ordered (one person interviewed)

(C) Project Manager (two persons interviewed)

(D) System Engineer (one person interviewed)

The roles involve in Static Validation Two involved eliciting feedback/ input regarding RAM:

(E) Developer (one person interviewed)

(F) System Test (one person interviewed)

(G) Upper Management (one person interviewed)

Dynamic validation:

 As the RAM model is completed, it is set to be tested in live development situation. The idea was to use the model for actual requirements engineering in order to validate its components and to check if the model was scalable to a real development situation. During the process of this type of validation, few questions are generated considering several aspects of RAM.
At the end this paper concludes stating the importance and the usage of the requirement abstract model. This will give clarity about the requirements and helps in taking decision for any future work on a particular requirement.

“Introducing Support for Release Planning of Quality Requirements – An Industrial Evaluation of the QUPER Model”

This paper highlights the importance of finding the right balance among competing quality requirements for market success.  For this purpose a model is developed that uses quality dimensions with addition to the cost and value dimensions while prioritizing the functional requirements. This paper presents a quality performance (QUPER) model which supports release planning and road mapping of quality requirements and it also presents one case of QUPER tailoring, implementation, and most important evaluation, conducted at Sony Ericsson. The main purpose of this is to investigate the implementation of QUPER in industry. This model involves three steps.

Step1.  Problem definition

Step2.  Model definition

Step3. Model validation

In the first step, the understanding of different requirement decision scenarios is done along with the identification of the need for a cost-benefit model including quality aspects to support road mapping and scoping.

The second step is based on the inputs of the first step. This step includes three kinds of view (QUPER benefit view, QUPER cost view, QUPER roadmap view)
In the QUPER benefit view, three breakpoints that indicate the principal changes in the benefit level with respect to experience and market value. A breakpoint is an important aspect of non-linear relation between quality and benefit. The three breakpoints are listed below:
a.	The utility breakpoint: represents the border between a quality level useless and useful quality.
b.	The differentiation breakpoint: represents the shift from useful to competitive quality, which makes them have a competitive market proposition.
c.	The saturation breakpoint: breakpoint imply a change in quality level from competitive to excessive quality, where higher quality levels have no practical impact on the benefit in the particular usage context considered.
In QUPER cost view, the notation of cost barriers that represents the non-linear relation between quality and costs is included.
In QUPER roadmap view, combines benefit and cost views by position the breakpoints and barrier together ordered on the same scale.

In the third step the evaluation of the model which is generally carried out through interviews and expert decisions is included.
All the above three steps are carried out in Ericsson by considering only benefit view since it is the most important part of the QUPER model. This implementation process is done in four steps:
1.	Define quality aspects.
2.	Estimate your product’s current quality and the competing products’ quality.
3.	For each quality aspect and for each relevant qualifier, estimate the breakpoints.
4.	Estimate candidate targets and discuss and decide on actual targets for coming releases.

Later in this paper a detailed description of practical application of QUPER model by conducting interviews and involving experts of the company. The results indicate that the quality performance model provides helpful information about quality requirements in release planning. And also the main identified challenge was difficulties to identify and specify the values for the differentiation and saturation breakpoints. Furthermore, different understanding of the breakpoints value among the staff was raised as a challenge.
