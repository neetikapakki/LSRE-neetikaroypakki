<h5>Week 46:</h5>

In order to start my work, I have first tried to understand what the release plan is about. After that I have went through the given issues to get an idea on each of the issues. Few issues were easy to understand, whereas the other few issues were not clearly understood. In this week, Iâ€™ve tried to learn and think about some issues to get a new idea for those issues.     


<h5>Week 47 and Week 48:</h5>


By commenting, my ideas and thoughts were expressed for few issues. I have posted few questions to some issues in order to clarify my doubts. Whereas on the other side, I left few issues untouched since I did not understand them clearly and ran out of thoughts while dealing with those issues.   

The issues I have dealt with are as follow:

 Issue 61 incorrect login 

If the user enters an incorrect user id and/or password the login page shall be reloaded with information showing that an incorrect login has been attempted.

Comment:

Since the account is related to the course, instead of blocking the user if he enters the in-current id/ password for more number of time, the user should be provided with options such as (email verification code so that the user can retrieve the id/password) for retrieving his password

Issue 48 Access to Edit Course Info (syllabus) 

Only System Administrators shall be able to edit the contents of the course info (course syllabus). In many cases (especially in universities), the course info is approved by an educational board, and is changed very seldom. To avoid changes by mistake, access to edit the course info is restricted to system administrators.

Comment:

Even the course administrator should be given the access to edit the info of the course (course syllabus, course schedule, list of the participants) since the course administrator have a better idea / close view regarding the course status.

Issue 20 (Course Calendar)

It shall be possible to attach a calendar to a course.
We will use this to present information about e.g. lectures to course participants.

Comment: 

This calendar should be able to get updated every time a change is made.
I got the response asking where else this feature be useful. So I still need to work on this issue.

Issue 46 (Access to Personal Calendar)

Only the owner of a personal calendar shall be able to view, add and remove calendar items in the personal calendar.

Comment: 

Since only the owner has the access to his calendar, features such as setting an alarm on a particular time and date, personal notes of his in a specific date, reminders and many more can be added to improve the demand and usability of this calendar. For this comment I was asked to add requirements.

Issue 23 (Discussion Forum)

It shall be possible to attach a discussion forum to a course. This facilitates communication between course participants and from the course tutors/administrator. The customer wants something that functions like USENET news, but only accessible within the product

Comment: 

I was asked to add requirements for this issue as my comment was "the customer may face problem at the starting stage as it is complicated for user using it for the first time if he is willing to have something that functions like USENET and also many unwanted links arises while working on this product."

Issue 13 (Quick and Easy Overview of Relevant Information)

It shall be easy to find relevant information.
The users want to find the relevant information quickly. This means that it shall be easily accessible and presented in a way so that it is easy to get an overview.

Comment: 

What kind of relevant information are we discussing about?? And are we categorizing the information which will help the user to access the data easily?


<h5>Week 49:</h5>


In this week I have tried to find the dependencies and also commented for the responds on my previous issues.

Issue 40 (Personal Start Page Contents)

The Personal Start Page shall contain: Courses that the user is participator in, unread news items from these courses, link to the personal profile, personal calendar.

Comment: 

I have duplicated this issue with the issue 11, but after the result i have learnt that it is a clarification of issue 11 and not duplication.

Issue 50 (CRUD Course links)

It shall be possible to create/read/update/delete links to the list of links attached to a course.

Comment: 

I have duplicated this issue with the issue 50.

Issue 49 (View Course Links)

It shall be possible to view links attached to a course.

Comment: 

I have duplicated this issue with the issue 22.

Issue 13 (Quick and Easy Overview of Relevant Information)

It shall be easy to find relevant information.
The users want to find the relevant information quickly. This means that it shall be easily accessible and presented in a way so that it is easy to get an overview.

Comment: 

I was asked to add requirements for this issue as my comment was "what kind of relevant information are we discussing about?? And are we categorizing the information which will help the user to access the data easily??"

<h5>Week 50</h5>

I have identified and added new requirements that were not mentioned in the previous issues.

Issue 106 (Access to edit, delete and add the books in course library)

The course tutor is given the access to add, edit and delete the books from the course library.
The students of the course have the access to view the books and also are given the privilege to add the books and delete the books they have added to the course library.

Issue 105 (Course library)

This option helps the course tutor to create a separate library which contains the books that are need for the students of a particular course.


Work:
Among all the areas that are covered in the release planning, i have selected the area that deals with the calendar due to my personal interest on dealing with this area, so i have self-assigned those issues that are related to this area.
i have started assigning myself to some of the issues #46(Access to personal calendar), # 45(Access to change course calendar), #20(Course calendar)in this area.

Work 
In this week, I have also assigned few more issues which come under the area I am interested in and also the issues that i have created.  The issues that are selected are as follow:
#25 (User calendar) # 43 (CRUD Calendar item) #44 (Synchronise Calendar) #66 (Calendar Items content) #70 (Cannot import calendar) #105( course library) #106 (Access to Add, Edit, Delete the books in the course library).
Later in the same week, a joint meeting of all our course mates was conducted. As each milestone is associated with a particular goal, we have identified those requirements that are needed to reach the goal and only these requirements that are needed were placed under the corresponding goals. The next step was, we have selected grouping technique (MoSCoW) for prioritising the requirements in different classes such as Must have, Should have, could have and would have under each goal based on the customer value. The implementation of this technique depends on the availability of time and resources. If the organization has sufficient time and resources, all the requirements are implemented. After this meeting, I came to know which requirement belongs to which milestones. So I have listed all the requirements that I have assigned and placed them in the milestones they belong to.
