Reflected Report:

The reflected report is carried out by considering two articles. The methods used in these articles are understood clearly and the implementation of those methods are performed considering few requirements that are needed in different systems.

The lists of two articles are as follow:

1.	“Requirement Abstract Model”

2.	“A case study evaluation of the guideline-supported QUPER model for elicitation of quality requirements”

Article Selection: “Requirement Abstract Model”

The model applied in this article deals with the management of the continuous flow of the requirements in three activity steps (Specify, place and Abstraction). RAM focuses on placing the requirements in the correct level (product, feature, functional and components) it belongs to and creating links to all the levels for each of the requirements. This will give clarity about the requirements and helps in taking decision for any future work on a particular requirement. The reason for selecting this model is because it is clearly understood and the implementation of this model is practically possible. At the end of this report, after the implementation of this model by considering few requirements, I will get an idea about how far this model works in the right way.

Implementation plan:

In order to implement the Requirement Abstract Method (RAM), I have first considered a system that works for a particular area. For this purpose, I have selected “Online Food Service System”. For any kind of systems, requirements play an important role in the development process. To make the task manageable, I have considered only three requirements that are related to the online food service system. 

The implementation of this method will be done in three action steps. 

In the first step I will specify the requirement so as to get raw information about it. For this four attributes are specified (description, reason/ rational/ benefits, risks and title). Each requirement is specified with these four attributes for a clear understanding purpose.

The second step involves in placing the requirements in the level they belong to. There are four levels that any requirements may belong to. The four levels are the product level, the feature level, functional level and the component level. After specifying my requirements, I will place them in the levels they are fit for by referring to “how to guide”. 

The third action step is the abstraction level: Here by following the two rules, I will create new requirements so as to link all the levels (product to component) for each of the requirement. 

Execution and proof of concept:

By applying the concept of the RAM model, I have implemented the selected three requirements in the three action steps.

The three requirements that I have selected are;

R1. Tracking the order product (status)

R2. The system should provide the service to the authorized users

R3. The administrator has the privileges to add the product items to the product list.

These requirements are applied to the first action step i.e. to elicit/ specify the requirements using the four attributes. 

R1:

a.	Description: this requirement helps the user to know the current status of the ordered product by tracking it.

b.	Benefits: with this requirement the user will have an idea where exactly the ordered product is located.

c.	Title: “Status of your order”

R2:

a.	Description: Only the authorized users are provided with the services.

b.	Benefits: this provides security to the system.

c.	Risk: the user may forget the entered information.

d.	Title: “Registration”

R3:

a.	Description:  the system must provide functionality to administer of the products

b.	Benefits: this will give the access to the administrator of the product to make changes or modify the information in the service system. 

c.	Title: privileges given to the system administrator.

In the second step, placing of the requirements in different levels is done. The placing of the requirements is done by following few questions and answers to those questions will relieve to which level each requirement belongs.

If the requirements that belongs to the product level, it should be able to answer the question that says “if the requirement is comparable to the product strategies?”  This is answered by R2. So the second requirement R2 is placed in the product level.
For the requirement to be placed in the feature level, the question is if the requirements describe “what the system should include or support?” requirement R1 fits in this level.
The requirement R3 is placed in the functional level because it answers the question that say if the requirements is functional or not, or if the requirements in the question describes what characteristics a system should provide?

In the third action step, new requirements are created so as to link all the levels (product to component) for each of the requirement. 

For the requirement R2 which belongs to product level, new requirements are created that fits in feature level, functional level and component level.

Product level- the system should provide the service to the authorized users

Feature level- the system should allow the user to register.

Function level – the user to be able to add his/ her details into the registration form.

Component level- after successful registration, the system should display a message that the user is successful registered

For the first requirements R1 which belongs to feature level, new requirements are created that fits in product level, functional level and component level.

Product level: system should provide online services to the customers 

Feature level- Tracking the order product (status) 

Functional level: the system must be able to display all the ordered products with a status option.

Component level: the system should display the date of order and the current status of the delivery product when status button is clicked

For the first requirements R3 which belongs to functional level, new requirements are created that fits in product level, feature level and component level.

Product feature: the system must provide functionality to administer of the products

Feature level: the system must provide the details of all the products

Functional level: the administrator has the privileges to add the product items to the product list.

Component level: new products should be added along with the cost, picture, main ingredients and quantity of the products. 

Lessons Learned: 

 In large scale software development system, the development of a product in market involves a large number of requirements. It is crucial to manage and handle the large number of requirements in right way at the right time because poor management of the requirements may lead to a large impact on factors such as time, success rate, cost and standards of the software product. Large scale requirement engineering (LSRE) is defined based on the size of the requirements set that is considered in the market driven requirements. Handling the continuous flow of the requirements along with their interdependencies is a complex task to perform. This leads to the implementation of various prioritization techniques, and management models so as to control the flow of the requirements. One such kinds of model is the Requirement Abstraction Model (RAM). The model will allow companies to ensure comparability between requirements, and hence it generates important input to activities such as prioritization and packaging of requirements before launching a development project.
From the implementation of this model, the lesson that I learned is, handling the continuous flow of requirements is not an easy task, there are many challenges that I have faced. I learnt to overcome those challenge and continued my implementation task. Understanding the requirement in detail is not so easy. But with the help of this model, I have got a clear idea about the requirements that I have selected and applied to this model.

Reflections:

Another article related to the Requirement abstraction model is considered for the purpose of relating my implementation and the experience of this model. The article that I have selected is “A controlled empirical evaluation of a requirements abstraction model”. The author of this article has presented an evaluation of such a model that is built based on needs identified in industry. The evaluation’s primary goal is to test the model’s usability and usefulness in a lab environment prior to large scale industry piloting, and is a part of a large technology transfer effort. The evaluation uses 179 subjects from three different Swedish Universities. At the end of the test, the results provide a strong indication that the model is indeed both useful and usable and ready for industry trials. After going through the article and observing the results, with knowledge on this model, I strongly agree to the results that indicates both the useful and the usable of the product. I feel it is useful because as I have mentioned earlier that this model will give clarity about the requirements and helps in taking decision for any future work on a particular requirement. And the reason for agreeing that this model is usable is because the implementation of this model is not difficult and any number of requirements can be implemented to this model. Added to this, I have implemented this model by considering few requirements so this can be for a proof purpose of the usability of this model.
